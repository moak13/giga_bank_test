# giga_bank_test

A new Flutter project.

## Things to note
- This application is built using the stacked framework. Kindly visit the [website] (https://stacked.filledstacks.com)
- the framework has a CLI tool which allows you to speed up development. Kindly check that out also when you visit the website.
- This framework deals heavily on codegen, kindly make sure you use that to rebuild logic. Thankfully, stacked got us covered on that aspect as well. By calling `stacked generate` needed codegen counterparts are done.
- Plan to remove a feature due to business reasons, stacked has us covered as well by calling `stacked delete view <view_name>` or the likes based on what you need to do.
- Goodluck and have a nice ride.
